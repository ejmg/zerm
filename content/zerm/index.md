# hello

This is zerm, a minimalist theme for Zola based[^1] off of [panr's](https://twitter.com/panr)
theme for Hugo.

While it's largely faithful to the original, there are some changes:
- no prism.js integration, instead we use Zola's syntax highlighting to reduce overhead.
- removal of PostCSS and leveraging Zola's use of Sass for simple styling.
  - much thanks to [Pawe≈Ç
    Romanowski's](https://github.com/pawroman/zola-theme-terminimal/)
    independent fork of Terminal. Their Sass stylings saved me the overhead of
    figuring it out myself.
- no preview images. I want a theme that is focused on content.
- support for anchor links.
- Other small, opinionated changes that I think lend to the minimalism and
  aesthetic of zerm.
  
  
Things this theme does not have but either Terminal or Terminimal might:
- better short-codes for things like embedding videos or images, though I will
  work on this over time.
- better support for things like comments and social media. As of now, I have
  no plans to add this but [PR's are always
  **welcomed**](https://github.com/ejmg/zerm/pulls).
  
## A quick demo

`println!("inline code");`

```rs
fn main(n: String) {
    println!("hello, zola!");
}
```

here's a code block with long lines. does it handle well with horizontal scroll?

```rs
struct EgregiouslyLongExampleType {
    wow_these_are_some_really_long_field_names_you_probably_shouldnt_use_in_code: f64,
    like_really_dont_write_code_like_this_its_making_me_sad: String,
}

type Config = Option<String>; // lol you should use proper types

/// I'm being serious, please do not write code like this
impl FooBarBuzzBaz for EgregiouslyLongExampleType {
    fn stupidly_long_method_name(abstract_model_factory_generator_tuple_singleton_config: Config) -> Result<(), String> {
        match abstract_model_factory_generator_tuple_singleton_config {
            Some(cfg) => Ok(()),
            None => Err(String::from("lol what is an error type lol"))
        }
    }
}
```

### Header III

[^1]: fork? port? a little bit of the former, more of the latter?
